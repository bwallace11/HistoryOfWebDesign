  <h2>Early Web Era (1990–1994)</h2>

  <article>
    <h3>Tim Berners-Lee</h3>
    <p>
      Tim Berners-Lee invented HTML in 1990–1991 while working at the European
      Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN). He also created the first web browser,
      the first web server, and the first website.
    </p>
    <p>
      He designed HTML as a structural markup language derived from
      Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML).
      His core goals were openness, decentralization, and device independence.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1994, he founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) to guide the development
      of web standards and prevent fragmentation.

    <h3>Robert Cailliau</h3>
    <p>
      Robert Cailliau was a systems engineer at CERN who co-authored early web proposals
      and helped promote the Web within scientific institutions across Europe.
    </p>
    <p>
      While not the inventor of HTML, he played a crucial role in organizational support
      and early adoption of the Web.

    <h3>Marc Andreessen</h3>
    <p>
      Marc Andreessen co-created the Mosaic browser at the National Center
      for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA). Mosaic introduced inline images and
      made the Web graphical, dramatically increasing public adoption.
    </p>
    <p>
      He later co-founded Netscape Communications, which became central
      in the browser wars era.

    <h3>Dave Raggett</h3>
    <p>
      Dave Raggett authored early HTML drafts and played a major editorial role
      in HTML 3.0 and HTML 4.0. His work helped formalize HTML’s structural philosophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      He also documented HTML’s early history and contributed to improving
      interoperability across browsers.

    <h3>Dan Connolly</h3>
    <p>
      Dan Connolly contributed to HTML 2.0 standardization efforts through
      the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and later worked with the W3C.
    </p>
    <p>
      He focused on semantic clarity and machine-readable web structures.

  <h2>Modern HTML5 Era (2004–Present)</h2>

  <article>
    <h3>Ian Hickson</h3>
    <p>
      Ian Hickson served as the primary editor of HTML5 and played a central role
      in the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG).
    </p>
    <p>
      He helped shift HTML toward a "Living Standard" model that reflects real browser
      behavior rather than versioned releases.

  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>
    HTML evolved through collaboration between inventors, browser vendors,
    standards organizations, and independent contributors.
    Its survival is largely due to strong advocacy for openness
    and backward compatibility.
