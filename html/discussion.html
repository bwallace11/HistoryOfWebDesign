  <h1>Discussion: The Evolution of HTML</h1>

<section>
  <h2>HTML Began as a Research Tool</h2>
  <p>
    HyperText Markup Language was never designed to become a global publishing platform.
    It was created at CERN as a tool for sharing scientific documents between researchers.
    Its early purpose was modest: structure documents and create hyperlinks.
  </p>
  <p>
    There was no layout system. There were no design ambitions.
    HTML described meaning, not appearance.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Web’s explosive growth was not planned — it was emergent.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>The Browser Wars Changed HTML’s Direction</h2>
  <p>
    In the mid-1990s, browser vendors competed aggressively.
    Netscape and Microsoft added features faster than standards bodies could respond.
  </p>
  <p>
    This created fragmentation. Authors wrote pages that worked in one browser
    but broke in another. Presentational tags like &lt;font&gt; and layout tables
    became common not because they were ideal, but because they solved immediate problems.
  </p>
  <p>
    HTML became less about structure and more about visual control.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Separation of Structure and Presentation</h2>
  <p>
    With HTML 4.0, the World Wide Web Consortium encouraged separating structure
    from design. Presentational elements were deprecated. Cascading Style Sheets
    were promoted as the proper tool for visual styling.
  </p>
  <p>
    This shift was philosophical as much as technical. It redefined HTML as
    a semantic language rather than a layout system.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, real-world adoption was gradual. Many websites continued using
    older practices for years.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>The XHTML Experiment</h2>
  <p>
    Around 2000, HTML was reformulated as Extensible HyperText Markup Language (XHTML),
    using strict XML syntax rules.
  </p>
  <p>
    XHTML promised cleaner markup and stronger validation. In practice,
    it proved too strict for the existing Web. Browsers failed to enforce
    true XML parsing consistently, and compatibility issues arose.
  </p>
  <p>
    XHTML 2.0 attempted a complete break from earlier HTML, but this break
    was unrealistic. The Web had already grown too large to rebuild cleanly.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>HTML5 and the Return to Pragmatism</h2>
  <p>
    In 2004, the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG)
    began developing what became HTML5.
  </p>
  <p>
    HTML5 embraced an uncomfortable truth: browsers define reality.
    Rather than idealizing a perfect system, the specification began documenting
    how browsers actually behaved — including how they handle malformed markup.
  </p>
  <p>
    The introduction of semantic elements such as &lt;article&gt;, &lt;section&gt;,
    and &lt;nav&gt; restored meaning to document structure.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>The Living Standard Model</h2>
  <p>
    HTML is no longer versioned as HTML6 or HTML7.
    Instead, it is maintained as a Living Standard.
  </p>
  <p>
    This model reflects the reality that browsers update constantly.
    Freezing specifications into rigid versions would not match
    how the Web evolves in practice.
  </p>
  <p>
    Backward compatibility became non-negotiable.
    Billions of pages must continue functioning indefinitely.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Key Tensions in HTML’s History</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Innovation vs Stability</li>
    <li>Strict correctness vs Real-world tolerance</li>
    <li>Vendor control vs Open standards</li>
    <li>Structure vs Presentation</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    HTML survives because it consistently chose survival over perfection.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Has HTML Finished Evolving?</h2>
  <p>
    HTML today feels stable and mature. Major structural changes are unlikely.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, incremental improvements continue:
    improved accessibility semantics,
    native interactive elements,
    and performance enhancements.
  </p>
  <p>
    HTML may no longer be revolutionary, but it remains foundational.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Reflection Questions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Would the Web be better today if early HTML had enforced stricter syntax?</li>
    <li>How did commercial competition shape HTML’s evolution?</li>
    <li>Is backward compatibility a strength or a burden?</li>
    <li>Was XHTML 2.0 doomed from the beginning?</li>
    <li>Does the Living Standard model create stability or continuous uncertainty?</li>
    <li>Has HTML reached architectural maturity?</li>
    <li>What does HTML’s history reveal about how technology standards should evolve?</li>
    <li>Did separating structure from presentation fundamentally improve the Web?</li>
    <li>How much influence should browser vendors have over standards?</li>
    <li>Is HTML’s flexibility the reason it survived?</li>
  </ol>
