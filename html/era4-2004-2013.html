<h1>XHTML 2.0 vs the emergence of HTML5</h1>

<p>
In the early 2000s, the W3C focused on <strong>XHTML 2.0</strong>, a proposed
successor to XHTML 1.x that broke compatibility with existing web content.
At the same time, browser vendors grew frustrated that the official road map
did not match real-world HTML usage.
</p>

<h2>The XHTML 2.0 path</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Removed familiar elements like <code>img</code> in favor of new
      XML-based patterns.]</li>
  <li>Required stricter XML rules, which many existing sites did not follow.</li>
  <li>Ultimately abandoned; XHTML 2.0 never shipped in mainstream browsers.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The birth of WHATWG HTML5</h2>
<ul>
  <li>In 2004, engineers from Apple, Mozilla, and Opera created the
      <strong>WHATWG</strong> (Web Hypertext Application Technology
      Working Group).</li>
  <li>They started work on “Web Applications 1.0,” which evolved into HTML5,
      focusing on backward compatibility and application features.</li>
  <li>The W3C later restarted its HTML Working Group and collaborated with
      WHATWG on HTML5 drafts.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Major contributors</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Ian Hickson</strong> – principal editor of the HTML5
      specification in WHATWG and W3C drafts.</li>
  <li><strong>Browser vendor representatives</strong> from Apple, Mozilla,
      Opera, Microsoft, and later Google – pushed for a practical, compatible
      HTML standard.</li>
</ul>
